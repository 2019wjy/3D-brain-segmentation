# 3D-brain-segmentation
!!!!! Code is still under development, contains a lot of comments. This will be fixed ASAP after 5. March !!!
This is a repository containing code to Paper 3D Dense-Unet for MRI brain tissue segmentation (that hopefully will be) published on TSP 2018 conference. Code is inspired by great repository https://github.com/jocicmarko/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation.
